# PyADF test ADFPlot_Interpolation
#
# Test interpolation capabilities of PyADF's Plot module
#
# The test performs a calculation on a water molecule and 
# extracts the total potential on the ADF grid. The potential
# on an evenly space cube grid is then calculated by interpolation
# and compared to the potential directly calculated on this grid.
#
# Test by Christoph Jacob, ETH Zurich and KIT, 2009-2010
