 PyADF Overview
 ==============

 PyADF is a scripting framework for quantum chemistry, with a special
 focus on multiscale simulations. For an in-depth introduction, see
 the overview article in U{J. Comput. Chem. B{32} (2011),
 2328-2338<https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jcc.21810>}.

 PyADF input files are Python scripts, in which the classes defined by
 the PyADF scripting framework are available by default.

 This is an example of a minimal PyADF input file::

     mol = molecule('h2o.xyz')
     job = adfsinglepointjob( mol, basis='TZ2P')
     results = job.run()
     print results.get_dipole_magnitude()

 B{Running PyADF calculations}

 To run a PyADF script, use

 C{pyadf input.pyadf}

 Type C{pyadf --help} for command line options.

 B{Basic steps of a PyADF calculation}

 The minimal PyADF script given above shows the typical steps for
 setting up a calculation using PyADF.

     1. B{Setting up the molecule}

     Molecules are represented using the L{molecule} class.
     In the simplest case, you just have to give the filename
     of an xyz file containing the coordinates.

     >>> mol = molecule('h2o.xyz')

     More complicated things are also possible, e.g., obtaining
     individual residues from a pdb file.


     2. B{Creating the job}

     Next, you have to create a job. Different kinds of jobs are
     available, among others L{adfsinglepointjob}, L{adffragmentsjob}
     and L{adfgeometryjob}.

     A simple ADF single point calculation, can be set up like this
     (C{myfiles} is the global file manager provided by PyADF):

     >>> job = adfsinglepointjob( mol, basis='TZ2P')

     More options for this job could be provided using the L{adfsettings} class.
     Other kinds of jobs might require more information for initialization,
     please look at the documentation.


     3. B{Running the job}

     Now you are ready to actually run your job:

     >>> results = job.run()

     This will now run the actual ADF calculation.


     4. B{Doing something with the results}

     The C{job.run()} method returns a results object, which is an
     instance of some subclass of L{adfresults} (depending on the
     type of job you ran).
     In the case of an ADF single point calculation, an instance of
     L{adfsinglepointjob} is returned. This object can now be used
     to obtain things that have been calculated, for instance the
     dipole moment:

     >>> print results.get_dipole_magnitude()
     0.6629161489

     It is up to you what you do with these results, you can just print them
     or do more complicated manipulations with them.

 Using these basic building blocks, more complicated workflows can be built.
 For more details, please have a look at the documentation of the
 individual classes and at the examples in test/testinputs.

 B{Further information}

 Detailed documentation of the available classes is available.
 The following classes are most commonly used in PyADF input files:

  - B{Molecular Coordinates}
    - For more on the manipulation of the molecular geometry, see L{molecule}
  - B{ADF Calculations}
    - The most important job and result classes for simple ADF calculations are:
      - ADF single point calculations: L{adfsinglepointjob} and L{adfsinglepointresults}
      - ADF geometry optimizations: L{adfgeometryjob}
      - ADF frequency calculations: L{adffreqjob}
      - ADF chemical shifts: L{adfnmrjob} and L{adfnmrresults}
      - ADF spin-spin couplings : L{adfcpljob} and L{adfcplresults}
    - For all ADF calculations, settings are defined with L{adfsettings}
    - For more on plotting and related functionality, see L{Plot}
  - B{Dalton, Dirac, and NWChem Calculations}
    - Dalton single point calculations: L{daltonsinglepointjob} and L{daltonsinglepointresults}
    - Dalton CC2 excitation energies: L{daltonCC2job} and L{daltonCC2results}
    - Dirac single point calculations: L{diracsinglepointjob} and L{diracsinglepointresults}
    - NWChem single point calculations: L{nwchemsinglepointjob} and L{nwchemsinglepointresults}
  - B{Multiscale Quantum Chemistry}
    - FDE calculations with ADF: L{adffragmentsjob} and L{adffragmentsresults}
    - MFCC calculations with ADF: L{adfmfccjob} and L{mfccresults}
    - 3-FDE calculations with ADF: L{adf3fdejob} and L{adf3fdejob}
    - WFT-in-DFT embedding calculations: L{wftindftjob}

 B{Tests and Examples}

 The directory C{tests/testinputs} contains a number of examples.
 To run one of these examples, either use the C{test_pyadf}
 testing program, or copy the C{.pyadf} input file together
 with all required coordinates files to a new directory.
 In this directory, run C{pyadf input.pyadf}

 More examples (including those from the JCC paper) will be
 made available shortly.

 B{Finally...}

 Any suggestions for improvements are welcome!

 If you are doing cool things with PyADF, please let us know!
