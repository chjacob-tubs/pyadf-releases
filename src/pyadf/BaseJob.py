    An abstract class for results of a calculation.

    Results objects are returned by the run() method
    of a L{job} object. This abstract class only stores
    the most basis information, a copy of the job that
    generated these results and a reference to the filemanager.

    The class hierarchy of the results classes corresponds to
    the one of the job classes.
    The constructor of the child classes are always passed
    an object of the parent class, plus additional information
    if necessary.
