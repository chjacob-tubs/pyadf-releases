#
# There  are  many kinds  of  Turbomole  computations  and all  yield  somewhat
# different results.  Hence,  we need many result classes.  But theire features
# will overlap heavily. In order to minimize redundancy, we define "intermdiate
# result  classes"  that  only  feature  one  specific  result.   Via  multiple
# inheritance, result  classes for any combination of  these results (featuring
# different kinds  of jobs)  can be  constructed with just  two lines  of code.
# Inorder to keep  Python's inheritance mechanism working, the  hirachy must be
# monotonous.  Therefore,  ALL  intermediate   classes  must  be  derived  form
# `TurbomoleResults' and  all user level  results classes must be  derived from
# classes  derived therefrom.  The intermediate  classes are  made  "privat" by
# prefixing  their names  with  an underscore.  A  user should  NEVER use  them
# directly.
