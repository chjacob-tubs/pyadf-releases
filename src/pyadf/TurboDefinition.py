This is an non-user level module to handle I{Turbomole}'s I{define}.

@author: Moritz Klammler
@contact: U{moritz.klammler@gmail.com<mailto:moritz.klammler@gmail.com>}

@bug: The module is horrible spaghetti code. It probably punches sweet little
      ponnies and eats small children. It should not be released without
      careful review!
@bug: The classes herein were originally written for a different setup.
@bug: The way exceptions are handled is mostly a mess.
@bug: Much redundant code.
@bug: Long strings are splitted among several lines in an ugly fashion using
      concatenation instead of implicite line joining.
