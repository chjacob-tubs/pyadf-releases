Support for I{SNF} computations using I{Turbomole} (other programs may be added).

It might be desireable to make this module more general and support any kind of
I{SNF} computations. However, my time to write it was rather limited and I
needed it only for a specific purpose. And last but not least, I don't know how
to use I{SNF} with other backends but I{Turbomole}. Adding an additional layer
of abstraction to derive more C{SNF...Job} classes should (at most) be a
moderately difficult task.
